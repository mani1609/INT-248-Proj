# Image Classification Using TensorFlow
### Problem Statement
 This project shows how to classify images of flowers. It creates an image classifier using a tf.keras.Sequential model, and loads data using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory. You will gain practical experience with the following concepts:
 * Efficiently loading a dataset off disk.
 * Identifying overfitting and applying techniques to mitigate it, including data augmentation and dropout. 

#### This project follows a basic machine learning workflow:
 1. Examine and understand data
 2. Build an input pipeline
 3. Build the model
 4. Train the model
 5. Test the model
 6. Improve the model and repeat the process

##### For this project I am using the [flower_photos dataset(zip)](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz).

### Keywords:
